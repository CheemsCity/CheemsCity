# CheemsCity

CheemsCity is a ** STEM online platform for people who want to learn robotics, electronics and coding**.
Now, we will offer some free courses on GitHub through Jupyter notebooks and later via an official website and app.
The repository contains all the material related to the robot's code.

We are going to lunch the first official kit on Kickstarter; however, you can also build it by yourself using the files in the Robot repository.
If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

The kit will contain: 
a CheemsCar, Cyber Cheems (pedestrians of the city), traffic sign and a modular street.

## How do i build one?
To build the robot follow the instructions in the Robot repository, while for the software open your raspberry pi and:
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install git and clone this repository.
3. Go to the CheemsCity directory and to install al the required packages, lunch:

```
4.Check our free courses on github or just have fun with your Robot!
