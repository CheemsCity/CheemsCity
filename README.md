# CheemsCity

CheemsCity is a **STEM online platform for people who want to learn robotics, electronics and coding**.
For starters, we will offer some free courses on GitHub through Jupyter notebooks and later via an official website and app.
The repository contains all the material related to the robot's code.

We are going to lunch the first official kit on Kickstarter; however, you can also build it by yourself using the files in the [Robot repository](https://github.com/CheemsCity/CheemsCar).
If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

The kit will contain: 
a CheemsCar, Cyber Cheems (pedestrians of the city), traffic sign and a modular street.

## How do i build one?
To build the robot follow the instructions in the Robot repository, while for the software open your raspberry pi and:
**requirements**: Python and pip installed.
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
2. You can install the common version of openCV with:
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
or you can install the [optimized version](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/10/09/optimizing-opencv-on-the-raspberry-pi/) (preferred).

3. Install `git` and clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/CheemsCity/CheemsCity.git
```
4. Go to the CheemsCity directory (`cd CheemsCity`) and to install all the required packages, run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Check our free courses on github or just have fun with your Robot!
