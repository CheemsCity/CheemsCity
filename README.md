# CheemsCity
 
CheemsCity is a STEM online platform for people who want to learn robotics, electronics and coding.
The repository contains all the material related to the Open Source robot ecosystem: 3d models, PCB files and codes.

We will realise an official kit made by us on kickstarter, but you can also build it yourself using the files in this repository.
If you build or buy one, please help the project by documenting bugs with a GitHub issue.

The kit contains: 
a CheemsCar, Cyber Cheems (the pedestrians of the cyty), traffic sign and a modular street.

## How do i build one?
